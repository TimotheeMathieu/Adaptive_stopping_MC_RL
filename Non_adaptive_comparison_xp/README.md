This folder contains the code used to reproduce Section 6.2 "Comparison with non-adaptive approach".

In this folder, we provide the script `exp_true_positives.py` used to reproduce Table 1.
The data from the paper "A hitchhikerâ€™s guide to statistical comparisonsof reinforcement learning algorithm" by Colas, C., Sigaud, O., Oudeyer, P.Y. is included in the folder `data` under the names `evals_sac_hc.txt` and `evals_td3_hc.txt`.

In the script, we changed the parameters of the problem to smaller scale experiment in order to be able to execute it in reasonable time. Please edit the script `exp_true_positives.py` accordingly (there are comments in the script to explain where) to reproduce Table 1.

The adastop library must be installed with `pip install .` from the root of the repository.
