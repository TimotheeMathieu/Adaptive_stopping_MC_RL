CODE
====

* `compare_agent.py`  : main algorithm, contains the permutation group sequential testing proposed in the article.
* `non_adaptive` : implementation of the code from [How Many Random Seeds? Statistical Power Analysis in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08295.pdf) by
    Cedric Colas1, Olivier Sigaud and Pierre-Yves Oudeye (2018).
* `example_deeprl` : contains some example scripts of the use of our algorithm with deep rl algorithms.
* `example_toy` : contains some example scripts used to sanity check the algorithm in some toy settings.
