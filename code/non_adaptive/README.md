Non adaptive comparison of agents
=================================

This code is an implementation of the algorithm in [How Many Random Seeds? Statistical Power Analysis in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08295.pdf) by Cedric Colas1, Olivier Sigaud and Pierre-Yves Oudeye (2018)

This is a post-experiment approach that tests that two agents are different after the experiment has been made.
