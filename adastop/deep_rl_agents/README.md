# deep_rl_agents

Contains implementations of four Deep RL algorithms:
1. PPO from [rlberry](https://github.com/rlberry-py/rlberry/).
2. SAC from [Stable Baselines 3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3).
3. DDPG from [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl).
4. TRPO from [MushroomRL](https://github.com/MushroomRL/mushroom-rl).

Note that each one of these scripts has different requirements depending on the library that implemented them.
