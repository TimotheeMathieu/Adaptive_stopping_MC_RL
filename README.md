# Adaptive_stopping_MC_RL

Adaptive stopping when evaluating RL agents with evaluation estimated through Monte-Carlo methods.

TODO:
- [ ] See about power and sample-size requirements.
- [ ] See about multiple testing to test multiple agents at the same time. Use Bonferroni?
- [ ] See about theoretical results on the permutation GST.
- [ ] Do the simulation studies
- [ ] Do the empirical studies.
