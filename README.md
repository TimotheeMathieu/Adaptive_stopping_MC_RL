This repository can be used to reproduce all the experiments in the paper "AdaStop: sequential testing for efficient andreliable comparisons of Deep RL Agents".

The structure of the repo is the following:

- Folder `adastop` contains code of AdaStop
- Folder `toy_examples_xp` contains code for Section 6.1 "Toy examples"
- Folder `Non_adaptive_comparison_xp` contains code for Section 6.2 "Comparison with non-adaptive approach"
- Folder `Deep_RL_xp` contains code for Section 6.3 "AdaStop for Deep Reinforcement Learning"


# Installation

To install adastop, use pip: from the root of adastop directory,
```
pip install --user .
```

This will automatically install the command line interface as well as the python library.
